# Gazoot Ruby Application 

## Description

Gazoot is a quiz/action hybrid created using Ruby where answering questions correctly (and quickly!) allow you to attack and take down a monster! Winning the game involves answering enough questions to take the monsters health down to 0, with faster players being rewarded with a higher attack multiplier. This game was created as a way to review what was learnt in my first 2 weeks at Coder Academy and put it into practice.

Initially my first idea for an application was a workout tracker but I struggled to find motivation to complete and find a way to sufficiently meet the criteria of the assessment so the idea was scrapped in favour of Gazoot.

## Features

* Different quiz for each difficulty
* Recieve text input to select difficulty
* Display health of Player and Monster
* Victory and Defeat screens with final score
* Display time taken to finish quiz
* Reward user for completing quiz quickly
* Use of Ruby Gems colorize and artii

## User Interaction

Gazoot starts initially with a welcome screen before the player is prompted to select a difficulty, with each difficulty has a different set of questions to answer.
